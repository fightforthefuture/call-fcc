<h1>Urgent: a splinter-group within the FCC is trying to kill net neutrality.</h1>
<p>
    FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has answered our calls and is
    <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/02/fcc-chairman-wheeler-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">
        planning to adopt strong net neutrality rules</a>, using Title II of the
    Telecommunications Act. But two FCC commissioners are going against Wheeler
    and trying to derail the whole process. We need <em>you</em> to remind them
    to stand with the public and make sure the Internet is equal for all.
